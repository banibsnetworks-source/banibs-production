<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary goal is to continue building out the BANIBS platform. During this session, the user introduced a series of new feature requests and a high-priority UI bug fix, significantly expanding the scope of work.

The key requests addressed were:
1.  **Activate BANIBS Favicon**: Correctly link all favicon assets in the main .
2.  **Build D-Series Revelation Hub UI**: Add a premium teaser card for the hub to the guest welcome page ().
3.  **Fix Business Verification System**: Debug and refactor the backend APIs to align with frontend expectations and fix role-gating issues.
4.  **Create CIL Module Scaffold**: Build an inert, non-operative backend placeholder for a future Cultural Intelligence Layer module.
5.  **Implement DDM Engine v1.2**: Build a full-stack Dismissal Detection Model as an internal admin tool for pattern analysis, complete with a detailed UI, scoring engine, and API.
6.  **Add Before You Call It Out Section**: Add a new companion content block to the guest welcome page and the book detail page.
7.  **(P0) Fix Navigation Bar Alignment**: Resolve a high-priority UI bug where the main navigation bar was not flush-left.
8.  **(P0) Build Book Vault Module**: The current and active task is to build a new admin-only Book Vault to manage the founder's written works with versioning and export capabilities.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS**:
-   **P0 - Build Book Vault Module (Current Priority)**: Create a new full-stack module at  for managing books, chapters, and content blocks with versioning.
-   **P1 - End-to-End Test of Business Verification System**: After the Book Vault, conduct a full verification test of the owner upload flow, admin approval, and verified badge display.
-   **P2 - Fix Events Page API**: The  endpoint is still returning a 502 error. This remains an unfixed backend issue.
-   **P3 - Resolve Blocked Social Hero Images**: The social landing page hero images are blocked pending user-provided assets. This task is on hold.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB project. Several major features and fixes were completed in this session:
-   The **DDM Engine v1.2** is fully implemented and accessible at . It includes a feature-rich UI for creating and analyzing observations, a backend scoring engine, and guarded API endpoints.
-   The **D-Series Revelation Hub** has a new teaser card on the  page, and the main hub/detail pages are visually complete.
-   A new content section, **Before You Call It Out,** has been added to both  and the book detail page.
-   The backend for the **Business Verification System** has been significantly refactored, and the admin review page is now accessible after fixing role-based access control issues.
-   The high-priority **navigation bar alignment bug** has been fixed.
-   The backend scaffolding for the **CIL Color Dissociation module** and the **Book Vault module** has been initiated.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Initiating the build of the **Book Vault module**. The agent created the initial backend files for the data models and API routes.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: After completing the backend, the agent needs to build the frontend. Testing should involve both backend testing (using  for API endpoints) and frontend testing (using the screenshot tool to verify the new admin pages at ).
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: **(P2)** Backend returns a 502 Bad Gateway error for the  endpoint.
-   Issue 2: **(P3)** The social landing page hero images are a point of recurring friction and are currently blocked pending user-provided assets.

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1**: Backend API for Events page is failing.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: A frontend-only fix was implemented in a previous session to mask the error by displaying a user-friendly message. The root cause has not been addressed.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Check backend logs for errors related to : ==> /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log <==
