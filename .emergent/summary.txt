Note: This fork belongs to the Emergent BANIBS build (blacknative-hub). Do not mix with Sintra builds. Emergent is the canonical Phase 6.x source.
The AI engineer successfully guided the BANIBS application through several significant development phases. Initially, work focused on critical foundational elements: establishing a unified authentication system (Phase 6.0) and fixing a news image rendering bug (Phase 6.2). Following this, a core user experience component, the Hub v1 Dashboard (Phase 6.1), was implemented, integrating various data sources. Subsequent phases expanded interactive capabilities, including Notifications (6.2.1), Messaging (6.2.2), and comprehensive Resources and Events modules (6.2.3), covering both backend APIs, data seeding, and frontend UI integration. Most recently, the platform gained enhanced content discoverability through Feed Filtering and Unified Search (6.2.4), alongside crucial UX refinements like the BANIBS Network dropdown and stub pages. The project is currently transitioning into Phase 6.3, with Day 1 completing the backend implementation of AI Sentiment Analysis, and Day 2 initiating the UI integration of sentiment badges.

<product_requirements>
The BANIBS platform aims to build a dynamic digital ecosystem connecting Black and Indigenous communities with news, business, education, and opportunities. Key requirements include:
1.  **Dynamic News Aggregation**: Live news feeds from diverse RSS sources with deduplication, image handling, and scheduled updates. This now includes a robust fallback image system.
2.  **Consistent Design System**: Soft glass aesthetic via a BANIBS Identity Layer Contract.
3.  **Featured Video System**: BANIBS TV section with CDN integration (pending).
4.  **Global News & Regional Filtering**: World News with regional categorization and filter UI (feed filtering partially implemented).
5.  **Image Rendering Fix**: All articles now have real images or branded fallbacks.
6.  **Regional Engagement Analytics (Phase 6.2)**: Click tracking, Trending widgets, and admin APIs (partially implemented).
7.  **AI Sentiment Analysis (Phase 6.3)**: Sentiment modeling per story/region, public/admin endpoints. Backend is implemented, UI integration is starting.
8.  **Expanded Phase 6.x (v1.3.2)**: Unified Identity (SSO, implemented), Social Media MVP, Membership Tiers, Marketplace, Education/Language Tools, Cross-App Navigation, user-contributed stories, Business Directory v2 (partially implemented).
9.  **Hub v1 Dashboard**: A post-login unified dashboard integrating news, community, business, and opportunities (implemented with live data for Resources and Events).
10. **Interactive Layer Integration (Phase 6.2)**: Notifications, Messaging, Resources & Events modules (all implemented), feed filtering and unified search (implemented).

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in **Phase 6.3 Day 2: Sentiment UI Integration**.
Phase 6.3 focuses on integrating AI/Sentiment capabilities into BANIBS. Day 1, which completed the backend work, ensured that news and resources items are auto-tagged with sentiment scores (, , ). This involved:
- Creating  for rule-based sentiment analysis.
- Adding sentiment fields to the  and  Pydantic models.
- Implementing  to process existing data.
- Creating an admin endpoint  to trigger sentiment analysis on demand.
- Integrating sentiment analysis into  for new articles and into  for resource creation/updates.
- Registering the new sentiment router in .
- Backend tests confirmed successful sentiment application and API responses.

Now, Day 2 has just begun, with the explicit goal of surfacing this sentiment data in the UI. The immediate task is to create a reusable sentiment badge component that can be displayed on the Hub feed and Search page.
