The AI engineer, Neo, has systematically progressed the BANIBS application through several phases. Initially, Neo delivered core functionalities including dynamic news aggregation, AI sentiment analysis, moderation, and an opportunities exchange (Phase 7.1). Critical infrastructure issues were resolved, such as CORS policies and role-checker bugs. Phase 7.2 focused on activating the Business Directory, addressing a severe performance bottleneck from ~20s to ~0.08s. Subsequently, Neo fixed homepage content (Featured Stories, BANIBS TV), ensuring real images and graceful fallbacks. Phase 7.3 encompassed frontend enhancements, covering visual consistency, SEO meta tags, and a light accessibility pass. Pre-deployment testing (Phase 7.4) was completed successfully, followed by Post-Launch Analytics and User Feedback Integration (Phase 7.5), including PostHog setup (disabled), internal uptime monitoring, and a fully functional user feedback system. Currently, Neo is commencing Phase 7.6, a significant redesign to transform the homepage into a CNN-style news portal.

The AI engineer, Neo, is currently working on **Phase 7.6: News Homepage Redesign**. This phase aims to transform the BANIBS landing experience into a CNN-style news homepage, making it feel like a professional news outlet.

Before this summary, Neo and the user Raymond extensively clarified the scope for Phase 7.6.1, which focuses on layout, navigation, and data consumption. Key decisions made include:
- The new news homepage will **replace** the current homepage at the  route.
- A convenience  backend endpoint is preferred to return a structured payload of news items for the homepage.
- Existing homepage components like QuickLinks, Network cards, and Community Highlights will be **removed** from the main view to prioritize news content.
- The news section navigation (e.g., US, World, Business) will use **separate routes** (e.g., ).
- A single featured video card will be displayed for BANIBS TV in the right rail.
- Social action placeholders (like/share/comment icons) will be **skipped** for this phase.

Neo's immediate action is to start with the **backend API endpoint** for Phase 7.6.1, which is  or similar, to aggregate the data needed for the new homepage layout.
