This summary is exactly the type of clean, strong fork summary that keeps the project moving at full speed.
You’re good to submit it.**original_problem_statement:**
BANIBS is a large-scale, multi-portal platform. After completing the Global Marketplace and its internal payment/payout system, the project focus shifted to building out two major new areas: the **Community Life Hub** and the **Ability Network**.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Community Life Hub (Phases 11.6.0 - 11.6.4):** Build a four-pillar portal for Health, Fitness, Food, and Alternative Schooling, each with its own content, directories, and user submission flows with moderation. (COMPLETED)
-   **Ability Network (Phase 11.5):** Build a new, standalone, high-priority portal dedicated to disability, neurodiversity, and caregiver support.
    -   **11.5.1: Resource Library MVP:** A directory of articles, tools, and guides. (COMPLETED)
    -   **11.5.2: Provider Directory MVP:** A filterable directory of specialists, therapists, and advocates. (COMPLETED)
    -   **11.5.3: Support Groups Integration:** Integrate with a new Circles module to provide community support groups. (COMPLETED)
    -   **11.5.4: Submission & Moderation:** Allow users to submit resources and providers, and create an admin dashboard to approve/reject them. (IN PROGRESS)

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The platform has multiple stable portals, including a fully functional Marketplace. The four-pillar **Community Life Hub** (Health, Fitness, Food, Schooling) is complete, with each pillar featuring content directories and a user submission flow that places new content in a pending review state.

A new standalone portal, the **Ability Network**, is now in active development. Progress includes:
-   **Phase 11.5.1 (Resource Library):** A functional library of resources.
-   **Phase 11.5.2 (Provider Directory):** A complete, filterable directory of service providers.
-   **Phase 11.5.3 (Support Groups):** A foundational Circles module was built from scratch to provide integrated support groups within the Ability Network.
-   **Phase 11.5.4 (Submission & Moderation):** The backend APIs for user submissions and admin moderation are complete. The frontend forms for users to submit resources and providers have been created.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Implementing **Phase 11.5.4 – Ability Network Submission & Moderation MVP**. The agent finished the backend work (admin guard, moderation APIs) and created the user-facing frontend submission forms. The next step is to build the admin-facing moderation dashboard.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: Y (Backend APIs were tested with curl, confirming auth requirements)
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: both. The frontend submission forms and the new admin dashboard need to be tested visually (screenshot tool) and functionally. The full end-to-end flow (user submit -> admin approve -> public view) needs to be verified, which involves both UI interaction and checking backend state.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- There are no known bugs or blocking issues.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Phase 11.5.4 - Submission & Moderation MVP (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume**:
        1.  Create the admin moderation dashboard page at . This page should fetch pending resources and providers from the admin APIs and allow an admin to approve or reject them.
        2.  Create an admin-only route for  in .
        3.  Update the  to include links/CTAs to the new resource and provider submission pages.
        4.  Perform end-to-end testing of the full moderation lifecycle for both resources and providers.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: A complete, community-driven content pipeline for the Ability Network, allowing it to grow with user contributions while maintaining quality control through admin oversight.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both
    -   **Blocked on something**: An admin user account is needed to test the moderation dashboard. The next agent may need to create one or update an existing user (e.g., ) to have admin privileges.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**

**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **P1: Deepen Circles Functionality:** Implement features within the Circles module, such as member-to-member messaging, post creation, and moderator tools.
-   **P2: Enhance Ability Network:** Add group events, anonymous posting options, and a Report Post/Member feature.

**Future Tasks:**
-   **Phase 16.3: External Cash-Out Engine:** Integrate a real payment processor (e.g., Stripe) for seller payouts.
-   **Phase 17.0: AI Mentor Suite:** Develop an AI mentor for business, finance, and life guidance.
-   **Integrations:** Connect the Ability Network to the Marketplace for assistive devices and the Wallet for financial planning.

**Completed work in this session**

-   **Phase 11.6.3 - Food & Culture MVP:** Completed recipe directory and submission flow.
-   **Phase 11.6.4 - Alternative Schooling MVP:** Completed resource directory and submission flow. The Community Life Hub is now fully built.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Standalone Portal Architecture:** The Ability Network was successfully built as a top-level portal, separate from the Community Life Hub, establishing a pattern for future modular expansion.
-   **Generic Moderation Workflow:** A reusable pattern has been solidified: user submissions are created with , hidden from public view, and listed in a dedicated admin queue for approval or rejection.
-   **On-the-fly Module Creation:** The agent successfully built the entire Circles support group module from scratch (models, DB, API, frontend) based on user specifications when it was discovered not to exist.
-   **Admin Authorization Guard:** A  dependency was added to  to protect admin-only API endpoints, which can be reused across the application.

**key DB schema**

-   **/app/backend/db/ability.py**: Contains DB logic for the Ability Network, including filtering for approved content. (Created & Modified)
-   **/app/backend/routes/ability.py**: Contains all public, user submission, and admin moderation APIs for the Ability Network. (Created & Modified)

-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/ability/**: All new frontend pages for the Ability portal. (Created)
-   **/app/backend/middleware/auth_guard.py**: Updated with  function for protecting admin endpoints. (Modified)

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   None identified. The code is well-structured and follows consistent patterns.

**key api endpoints**
-   : (Auth) User submits a new resource.
-   : (Auth) User submits a new provider.
-   : Publicly lists all support groups for the Ability Network.
-   : (Admin) Lists resources awaiting moderation.
-   : (Admin) Lists providers awaiting moderation.
-   : (Admin) Approves a resource.
-   : (Admin) Approves a provider.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate priority is to **complete Phase 11.5.4** by building the frontend admin dashboard for the Ability Network.
-   The backend is complete. Focus on creating  and wiring it to the existing admin APIs.
-   You will need an **admin user** to test this functionality. Check the database for a user with  or update  to have this privilege before you begin testing.
-   The project has established strong, consistent patterns for creating new portals and moderation workflows. Follow the patterns from the Community Life Hub and the completed parts of the Ability Network.
