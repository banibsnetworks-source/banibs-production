and fork the session cleanly.**original_problem_statement:**
The user is building a large-scale, multi-portal platform called BANIBS. The project is developed in distinct phases.

The initial work focused on the BANIBS Marketplace, completing:
-   **Phase 16.0:** Global Marketplace with mock payments.
-   **Phase 16.1 & 16.1.5:** Integration of a real internal BANIBS Wallet for payments, including both backend and frontend.
-   **Phase 16.2:** A seller payout engine, allowing sellers to see their balances (pending vs. available after a T+2 clearing period) and request withdrawals.

Following the completion of the marketplace's financial loop, the user pivoted to a new major initiative:
-   **Phase 11.6-11.9: BANIBS Community Life Hub.** This is a unified portal for four key quality of life pillars for the community: Health & Insurance, Fitness & Movement, Food & Culture, and Alternative Schooling.

The current focus is on building this Community Life Hub pillar by pillar.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Phase 11.6.0: Community Hub Infrastructure:** Build the backend models, DB layer, API skeletons, and frontend layout/routing for the four-pillar Community Hub. (COMPLETED)
-   **Phase 11.6.1: Health & Insurance MVP:** Build out the Health pillar with a searchable/filterable directory of culturally competent health providers and a library of health resources. (COMPLETED)
-   **Phase 11.6.2: Fitness & Wellness MVP:** Build out the Fitness pillar, including a directory of fitness programs and coaches, with a basic enrollment flow. (IN PROGRESS)
-   **Future Pillars:** Subsequently build the Food & Culture (11.6.3) and Alternative Schooling (11.6.4) pillars.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a modular full-stack platform featuring several portals: Diaspora Connect, BANIBS Academy, BANIBS Wallet, a developer OS, a fully functional Global Marketplace with a complete internal payment and payout request system, and the newly initiated Community Life Hub.

The work on the Community Life Hub has progressed as follows:
-   **Phase 11.6.0 (Infrastructure):** The backend foundation (models, DB, API stubs) and frontend skeleton (layout, home page, placeholder pages for each pillar with unique color themes) are complete and tested.
-   **Phase 11.6.1 (Health MVP):** The Health pillar is functional, with enhanced backend models and APIs for filtering providers (by specialty, telehealth, etc.) and frontend pages for a provider directory, resource details, and provider details.
-   **Phase 11.6.2 (Fitness MVP):** The backend has been enhanced with models for , , and , along with corresponding DB logic and API endpoints. The frontend placeholder pages have been created.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Continuing the implementation of **Phase 11.6.2 (Fitness MVP)**. The agent just completed the backend enhancements for the Fitness pillar and created the necessary frontend files (, , ). The next step is to implement the UI and logic for these new pages.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N (Only backend APIs were created and tested with curl. Frontend UI is not built yet.)
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool. After building the UI for the new fitness pages, use the screenshot tool (after ensuring the test user is logged in) to verify the visual layout and data display. Testing the enrollment flow will require a combination of UI interaction and API verification.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Potential frontend testing flaw (P1)**
    -   In a previous step (Chat 346), a screenshot of an authenticated page returned a black screen, likely due to an unhandled login flow. The agent bypassed this by testing the API directly. The next agent must ensure the test user is properly logged in before using the screenshot tool to avoid this issue and ensure the UI is actually working.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Frontend for Fitness MVP (Phase 11.6.2) (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume**: Implement the UI and data-fetching logic inside the newly created frontend files:
        -   
        -   
        -   
        These pages should connect to the corresponding backend APIs (). The design should be consistent with the already-built Health pillar pages.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: This will deliver a functional Fitness pillar where users can browse programs and coaches, view details, and enroll in programs.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something**: None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**

**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **P1: Implement Fitness Enrollment Flow (part of Phase 11.6.2):**
    -   Add an Enroll button on the .
    -   This button should trigger a call to the  endpoint.
    -   Provide UI feedback for success or failure.
-   **P2: Build Food & Culture MVP (Phase 11.6.3):**
    -   Implement frontend pages for listing and viewing recipes.
    -   Create a user-facing form to submit new recipes (which will be marked as ).
-   **P3: Build Alternative Schooling MVP (Phase 11.6.4):**
    -   Implement frontend pages for the school resource directory.
    -   Integrate with the Circles module to show related schooling support groups.

**Future Tasks:**
-   **Phase 11.5: BANIBS Ability Network:** Build the deferred, high-priority portal for disability and caregiver support.
-   **Phase 16.3: External Cash-Out Engine:** Integrate a real payment processor (e.g., Stripe, Plaid) to handle actual bank transfers for seller payouts.
-   **Phase 17.0: AI Mentor Suite:** Develop a personal AI mentor for users for business, finance, and life guidance.
-   **Community Hub Enhancements:** Add deeper features like fitness challenges, wearable sync, meal planning tools, and lesson plan templates.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Phase 16.2 - Seller Payout Engine:** A full-stack feature allowing marketplace sellers to request cash-outs of their available earnings, which are moved from pending to available after a T+2 clearing period.
-   **Phase 11.6.0 - Community Life Hub (Infrastructure):** The complete backend and frontend skeleton for the new four-pillar portal, including models, DB layers, API stubs, a shared layout, and themed placeholder pages.
-   **Phase 11.6.1 - Health & Insurance MVP:** A functional health pillar with a filterable directory of healthcare providers and a library of health resources, including detailed view pages.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Modular Portal Architecture**: The app is built as a series of distinct portals, with the Community Life Hub being the latest major addition.
-   **T+2 Payout Clearing**: A backend script () implements a business rule to move seller earnings from a  to an  state after a 2-day hold period.
-   **Multi-Pillar UI/UX**: The Community Life Hub uses a shared layout and navigation but applies unique color themes (teal for Health, green for Fitness, etc.) to give each pillar a distinct identity while maintaining consistency.
-   **Filterable Directories**: The agent has implemented APIs and frontends with multi-factor filtering (e.g., by specialty, telehealth, Black-owned) for provider/resource directories.

**key DB schema**
-   **marketplace_sellers**: Extended with  (Decimal).
-   **marketplace_orders**: Extended with  (Enum: 'pending', 'cleared').
-   **marketplace_payout_requests**: New collection for tracking seller payout requests.
-   **community_... collections**:
    -   ,  (Contain detailed fields for filtering).
    -   ,  (Contain detailed fields for filtering).
    -    (New collection to link  to ).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate priority is **Phase 11.6.2: Complete the Fitness MVP frontend**.
-   The backend for this phase is already built and tested. You need to implement the UI for the pages in  that were just created for Fitness.
-   Follow the design patterns and structure established in the **Health MVP (Phase 11.6.1)** for consistency.
-   **Be aware of the screenshot testing issue**: Before taking screenshots of authenticated pages, ensure your testing flow includes logging in the test user () to avoid capturing a blank/login page.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: None. The application is stable.
-   **Mocked**: The seller payout withdrawal process is internally tracked but does not connect to a real external banking API. This is by design and scheduled for a future phase (16.3).

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES, for Phase 16.1.5.
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO.
-   **Test files created**: []
-   **Known regressions**: A screenshot of an authenticated page failed (showed a black screen), likely because the testing flow did not log the user in first. This is a process issue to be mindful of.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Email**: 
-   **Password**: 
-   This user is a registered seller, has a wallet with funds, and has a history of orders.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent did not successfully test the final UI of the Health MVP with a screenshot because the user was not logged in. While the API was verified, the final visual confirmation of the connected UI is pending and should be a priority for the next agent before moving on.
