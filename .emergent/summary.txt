<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's goal is to continue the development of the BANIBS platform. The session started with a request to verify the completed Messaging Engine (Phase 8.4) and then translate the UI to Spanish (Phase L.0).

However, the user introduced several high-priority quick patch requests and new feature directives throughout the session, causing frequent context switches. These include:
1.  **Marketplace Layout Fix**: Add global navigation to Marketplace pages to prevent users from being trapped.
2.  **Mobile App Development (Phases M1-M4)**: Build a new React Native application from the ground up, including auth, a social feed, comments, profiles, and notifications.
3.  **Social Homepage Crash Fix**: Resolve a blank screen issue on the  route.
4.  **Dashboard Repair**: A request to fix a reported issue with the social dashboard, which was later found to be working correctly.
5.  **Response clone Error**: A persistent frontend error that was ultimately traced back to a backend crash.
6.  **Sticky Button Fix**: Improve the UX of buttons on the social feed to prevent hanging.
7.  **New Registration Flow**: A detailed specification to overhaul the user registration page with new fields, validation, and a new post-registration onboarding screen.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB platform. Key features include a verified 1-to-1 messaging engine, a foundational i18n system with a fixed language switcher, a corrected Marketplace layout with global navigation, and a newly created React Native mobile app.

The mobile app () is a significant new component built across four phases (M1-M4), featuring:
-   Login/Register screens.
-   A tabbed interface (Home, Social, Messaging, Notifications, Settings).
-   A functional social feed with post creation, comments, and user profile navigation.
-   A media picker and notification system foundation.

The web backend crashed during the session due to an incomplete feature implementation but has since been stabilized by removing the broken code.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Implementing an enhanced user registration flow based on new user specifications. The agent was actively editing  to add new fields (First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Gender), along with the required state management and validation logic. The JSX for the new form fields was the next step.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent. This is needed to verify the new form fields, all validation rules (e.g., password match, age check), successful account creation, and the redirection to the new Welcome / Circles Intro screen.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - **Issue 1**:  (description with priority order)
    The backend is in a temporarily stable but incomplete state. The implementation of the Groups feature (Phase 8.5) was aborted mid-way, causing a server crash.
    
    Issues Detail:
    - **Issue 1**: Incomplete and Broken Groups Backend (P0)
       - **Attempted fixes**: The agent created backend files for the Groups feature (, , ) but the  introduced syntax errors. Instead of fixing the files, the agent deleted them but forgot to remove the corresponding router import in . This caused the entire backend to crash, which manifested as a Response clone error on the frontend. The immediate crash was fixed by commenting out the router import in .
       - **Next debug checklist**:
         1.  Recreate the backend files for the Groups feature (, , ) ensuring no syntax errors.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.

           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

============== 7 failed, 4 passed, 4 warnings, 3 errors in 2.04s =============== (if tests exist) to validate the new backend code.
         3.  Uncomment the router registration in .
         4.  Restart the backend service (backend: stopped
backend: started) and check logs for a clean start.
       - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: The Groups feature (Phase 8.5) is the next major planned feature. The backend must be completed and stable before any frontend work can begin. Fixing this unblocks a key part of the product roadmap.
       - **Status**:  NOT STARTED
       - **Is recurring issue?** N
       - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: backend
       - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - **Task 1**:  Complete the New User Registration Flow (P0)
    
   Task Detail:
    - **Task 1**: Complete the New User Registration Flow
       - **Where to resume**: The logic and validation function in  has been updated. The next step is to modify the JSX within the  statement of this component to add the new form inputs for First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, and Gender. After that, the  function needs to be updated to redirect to the new onboarding screen upon successful registration.
       - **What will be achieved with this?**: This will bring the registration process in line with the user's new requirements, capturing more detailed user information upon signup.
       - **Status**:  IN PROGRESS
       - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
       - **Blocked on something**: Creation of the Welcome / Circles Intro screen.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**

*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **P0: Create Welcome / Circles Intro Screen**: Create a new frontend page that new users are redirected to after registration. This page should explain the Circles concept as per user requirements.
    *   **P1: Phase 8.5 - Groups & Membership (Frontend)**: Once the backend is fixed, build the frontend UI for creating, joining, viewing, and managing groups.
    *   **P2: Phase 8.6 - Notifications Integration**: Connect the Relationship and Groups systems to the notifications UI.
    *   **P3: Translate Core Screens**: Continue the i18n work (Phase L.0) to translate remaining core screens into Spanish.

*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   Phase 11.20 - ThoughtCatcher & Memory Echo System™
    *   Phase X - FAP Full Implementation
    *   Phase 16.3 - External cash-out engine integration
    *   Phase 17.0 - AI Mentor Suite
    *   BANIBS SOVEREIGNTY SUPERMODULE (Phases 21-32)

**Completed work in this session**
- **Root Cause Analysis & Fix**: Diagnosed and fixed a persistent  frontend error by identifying the root cause: a backend server crash due to an incomplete feature implementation. Stabilized the backend by removing the faulty import in .
- **Mobile App Scaffolding (Phases M1-M4)**: Architected and built a complete React Native mobile application from scratch, including authentication, a tab-based navigation system, a functional social feed with post creation, comments, user profiles, and a foundation for media uploads and notifications.
- **Marketplace Layout Fix**: Corrected a major UI flaw by wrapping the  in the , ensuring the global navigation bar is present across all marketplace pages.
- **Sticky Button UX Improvement**: Enhanced the social feed by adding  and loading states to asynchronous buttons (, ), preventing spam clicks and improving user feedback.
- **Language Switcher Fix**: Implemented a user-provided solution to fix the language selection component (), ensuring state and  are managed correctly.
- **Social Homepage Crash Fix**: Resolved a blank screen issue by adding the missing  route to .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - The backend implementation for **Phase 8.5 - Groups & Membership** was started, found to be broken, and then abandoned. The files were deleted, but the fix was to comment out the router in , leaving the feature incomplete.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **React Native Development**: The agent demonstrated the ability to set up a complete mobile application from scratch using React Native, including navigation, state management (Context API), and a modular component structure.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: The agent successfully debugged a misleading frontend error () by eventually checking backend logs, revealing a server crash was the true culprit.
- **Asynchronous UX**: Implemented UI best practices for asynchronous operations by disabling buttons and showing loading states to provide clear user feedback and prevent race conditions.
- **Defensive Coding**: Created a centralized  utility to handle API responses robustly, preventing crashes from trying to parse the body of a failed response.

**key DB schema**
  - **(Aborted)** **groups**: The agent attempted to create schemas for groups, group_members, and posts, but the files were deleted. The intended schema likely included fields like , , , , .

**changes in tech stack**
- **React Native**: A new mobile application has been added to the project using React Native and Expo.

**All files**
- **/app/mobile/**: (NEW) An entire directory containing the new React Native mobile application.
- **/app/frontend/src/pages/auth/RegisterPage.jsx**: (IN PROGRESS) Modified to add new registration fields and validation.
- **/app/frontend/src/utils/fetchHelper.js**: (NEW) A utility created to standardize error handling for  API calls and resolve the Response clone error.
- **/app/backend/server.py**: (MODIFIED) The  import and registration were commented out to prevent a server crash. This is a temporary fix.
- **/app/frontend/src/components/marketplace/MarketplaceLayout.jsx**: (MODIFIED) Wrapped the layout's children with  to add the global navigation bar.
- **/app/frontend/src/components/social/SocialFeed.js**: (MODIFIED) Added  and loading state logic to refresh and error buttons to fix sticky button issue.
- **/app/frontend/src/components/settings/LanguageSettings.jsx**: (MODIFIED) Overhauled the language change logic to correctly use React state and sync with .
- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: (MODIFIED) Added a route for  to fix a blank page crash.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Prioritize Backend Stability**: The immediate backend crash is fixed, but the **Phase 8.5 Groups feature is broken and incomplete**. Before starting any new feature work, the backend for Groups must be properly implemented and integrated to prevent future crashes and unblock the feature roadmap.
- **Check Backend Logs**: The Response clone error was a major red herring. If multiple, unrelated frontend API calls start failing, **your first step should be to check the backend logs** (==> /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log <==

- **User Interrupts are Common**: The user frequently provides high-priority quick patch requests. Be prepared to pause your current task, address the user's immediate need, and then resume. Documenting where you left off is critical.
- **Current Task Context**: You are in the middle of implementing a new registration flow. The logic in  is partially done; the JSX needs to be built out next.

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User**: Fix the Social Home Dashboard... - This turned out to be a non-issue as the dashboard was already working. (Completed)
2.  **User**: continue all forward progress... continue mobile development - Instruction to proceed with Phase M3. (Completed)
3.  **User**: You’re clear to move forward. - Green light to start Phase M4. (Completed)
4.  **User**: Hey, Neo... this, uh, button is a little sticky on the social tab - A bug report about the social feed buttons hanging. (Completed)
5.  **User**: ✅ Create Account – Fields We Need... - A detailed new feature specification for overhauling the user registration process. This is the current, in-progress task. (In Progress)

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**:
    - **Phase 8.5 Groups Backend**: The feature was partially implemented, then the files were deleted, and the router was commented out in  to prevent a crash. It is non-functional.
- **Mocked**:
    - The hardware/AI-dependent layers of the FAP backend are mocked/stubbed by design (from previous session).

**Testing status**
  - **Testing agent used after significant changes**: NO (Agent self-tested with screenshots and curl).
  - **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
  - **Test files created**: None.
  - **Known regressions**: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- **User/Admin**:  / 

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent did not forget a task but left the **Phase 8.5 Groups backend** in a broken, half-implemented state after being interrupted by higher-priority bug fixes. This is a critical piece of technical debt that needs to be addressed.</analysis>
