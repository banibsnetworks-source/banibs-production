<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to resolve all existing blockers and implement a massive architectural update known as BANIBS MEGADROP V1. This involved unifying user identity (BGLIS/BDII) and implementing a Circle Trust Order social graph. After successfully deploying these foundational systems through multiple phases (A, B, and C), the user has introduced a new, high-priority feature request: the **BANIBS Peoples Room System**. This new system is a personal, persistent social space for each user, governed by the existing trust architecture but with highly granular user controls. Concurrently, the agent fixed a frontend layout bug where the main navigation bar was missing on the homepage.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS**:
- **Peoples Room System (New, P0)**: Implement the Peoples Room MVP (Phases 1-3) as per the detailed specification provided by the user. This includes a trust-aware knock system, multi-level access controls (per-person, per-circle, per-tier), and user-controlled room states (visibility, lock status).
- **Phase C Monitoring (Ongoing, P1)**: Continue the 2-week shadow mode data collection for the recently deployed trust-weighted feed ranking system.
- **Frontend Bug Fix (Verification Pending)**: Verify that the fix for the missing navigation bar on the BANIBS homepage is working as expected.
- **Resolve Production Sync Blocker**: The critical issue of manually syncing the workspace to the production GitHub repository remains.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB project. The foundational MEGADROP V1 architecture is largely in place:
1.  **Identity Unification (BGLIS/BDII)**: Complete. A single source of truth for all user identities.
2.  **Circle Trust Order**: Complete through Phase C.
    -   **Phase A (Shadow Mode)**: Done.
    -   **Phase B (Safe Rule Enforcement)**: Done.
    -   **Phase C (Extended Rules)**: Done and deployed. This includes comment permissions, notification filtering, and a trust-weighted feed ranking system running in **shadow mode**.
3.  **Peoples Room System**: The agent has begun implementing the backend. The initial model () and service shells (, , ) have been created but are not yet functional.
4.  **Frontend Bug Fix**: The code to fix the missing navigation bar on the homepage has been implemented and the service was restarted.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Commencing **Phase 1 (Core Backend)** of the **Peoples Room System**. The agent created the initial Python files for the backend models and services as outlined in the approved implementation plan.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Backend testing agent and unit tests (============================= test session starts ==============================

-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: Frontend Layout Bug - Missing Navbar (P1)
-   Issue 2: Production Deployment Sync (P2, CRITICAL)

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1: Frontend Layout Bug - Missing Navbar**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent identified that  had a hardcoded navigation bar instead of using the global . The component was wrapped in the layout, the redundant navbar code was removed, the frontend build was successful, and the service was restarted.
    -   **Next debug checklist**: The user was about to verify the fix but was interrupted by providing the Peoples Room spec. The next agent should ask the user to verify the fix or use the screenshot tool to confirm the global navigation bar is now present on the homepage ().
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: Ensures a consistent user experience and layout across all main application pages.
    -   **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None.

-   **Issue 2: Production Deployment Sync**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: This is a manual process that relies on the user to perform the Save to GitHub action from the UI. The agent has provided manifests but cannot automate this.
    -   **Next debug checklist**: Await user confirmation of the Save to GitHub operation. This is a recurring process blocker.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: Establishes a reliable CI/CD pipeline and ensures dev-prod parity. It is a critical risk for the project.
    -   **Status**: BLOCKED (on user action)
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   Task 1: Implement Peoples Room System (MVP - Phases 1-3) (P0)

    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: backend
    -   **Blocked on something**: None.

-   **Task 2: Monitor Phase C Shadow Mode Data Collection**
    -   **Where to resume**: This is a background task. The agent needs to periodically monitor the  collection, ensure data is accumulating, and prepare for the first weekly report.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: Gather at least two weeks of data to validate the trust-weighted feed ranking algorithm before deciding on live activation.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS (Monitoring Active)
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: N/A
    -   **Blocked on something**: Requires user activity on the platform to generate data.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    -   **P0: Peoples Room - Phase 2 (Visitor Flows)**: Implement visitor-side API endpoints (, , ) and permission logic.
    -   **P0: Peoples Room - Phase 3 (Basic UI)**: Build the frontend MVP, including the My Room page, presence indicators, knock/enter flows, and the settings panel.
    -   **P1: Analyze Shadow Mode Data & Report**: After 2 weeks, analyze feed ranking data and present activation recommendations to the user.

-   **Future Tasks**:
    -   **Peoples Room - Phase 4 & 5**: Integrate WebSockets for real-time events, add in-room chat/audio/video, and other extended features.
    -   **Activate Trust-Weighted Feed**: Based on shadow mode results and user approval.
    -   **API Error Shape Refactor**: Address inconsistent API error responses.
    -   **The rest of the BANIBS MEGADROP V1 blueprint**: ERA II, III, and IV features.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Circle Trust Order - Phase B (Safe Rule Enforcement)**: Completed and tested, enforcing DM and visibility rules based on trust tiers.
-   **Circle Trust Order - Phase C (Extended Rules)**: Completed, tested, and deployed.
    -   **Priority 1: Comment Permissions**: Fully implemented with moderation queues.
    -   **Priority 2: Notification Filtering**: Implemented with strict, tier-based batching.
    -   **Priority 3: Feed Ranking (Shadow Mode)**: Implemented and deployed for data collection.
-   **Frontend Bug Fix (Missing Navbar)**: Corrected the layout for the homepage to ensure the global navigation bar is always visible. The build was successful and the service restarted.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Inconsistent API error shapes and status codes**: This was mentioned in a previous audit report () and remains a pending refactoring task for future sprints.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Password reset emails not being sent.
-   **Recurrence count**: 2+
-   **Status**: BLOCKED. This is resolved for the development environment via a mock SMTP service, but a full production fix is blocked pending user-provided SMTP credentials.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frameworks**: React, FastAPI.
-   **Database**: MongoDB (via Motor).
-   **Core Architecture**: MEGADROP V1 (BGLIS/BDII Identity, Circle Trust Order).
-   **Peoples Room System**: A new sovereign social space feature with a knock system, multi-level access control (Access List > Circle > Tier), and user-controlled door/visibility states.

**key DB schema**
-   **peoples_rooms**: 
-   **room_sessions**: 
-   **room_knocks**: 
-   **comments**, **comment_moderation_queue**: Schema for managing comment creation and moderation.
-   **dm_requests**: Schema for the DM approval queue.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   **Peoples Room Spec**: The user's message detailing the BANIBS Peoples Room System (Chat Message 241).
-   **Peoples Room Plan**: 
-   **Phase C Docs**: , 
-   **New Services**: All files under  related to comments, notifications, feeds, and rooms.
-   **Homepage Fix**: .

**key api endpoints**
-   **DM Requests**: Endpoints added to  for managing DM queues.
-   **Tier Anomaly Logging**: Endpoint  updated to log large tier jumps.
-   **Peoples Room (Proposed)**:
    -   Owner: , , , 
    -   Knocks: , 
    -   Visitor: , , , 

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Peoples Room is Priority #1**: The user wants this feature implemented now, in parallel with Phase C monitoring. You must follow the approved plan in .
-   **Founder Decisions are Law**: The user has made specific decisions on Peoples Room logic:
    -   Exiting a room kicks all visitors.
    -   Locking a room keeps existing visitors but blocks new ones.
    -   Knock requests expire after a fixed 30 minutes.
-   **Sovereignty is Key**: The access control model is strict: **Per-Person Access List > Circle Rules > Tier-based Defaults**. The user is always in control.
-   **Phase C Monitoring is Active**: The 2-week data collection for feed ranking is a parallel background task.
-   **Verify Frontend Fix**: The navbar fix is implemented but unverified. A quick check with the user or screenshot tool is needed before diving deep into the Peoples Room implementation.
