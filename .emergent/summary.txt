<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary goal was to continue building out the BANIBS application's public-facing shell, referred to as the A-Series pages. This involved verifying the previously built Our Story page (A3) and then implementing a series of new, premium, variant-aware static pages: A4 (Business Page), A5 (Black News About Page), A6 (Social Landing Page), and A7 (Marketplace Landing Page).

During this process, the user requested several critical fixes and enhancements:
-   Separate the development preview experience from the production Coming Soon mode to allow for free browsing of the full app in dev.
-   Fix all routing related to the new  landing page, including the main navigation link and the Sign In/Create Account buttons, which were initially broken.
-   Implement a comprehensive Trust Tier Explanation Enhancement across the onboarding flow and other UI components to clarify relationship management for users.
-   Add the global navigation bar to the new social landing page for UI consistency.
-   Document a new Raymond Health Core System architecture for future development.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB project. The A-Series public shell is now functionally complete, comprising several high-quality, static, variant-aware landing pages (A2 through A7). The  logic has been updated to be active only in non-development environments, allowing developers to see the full application in the preview URL. The routing for the social features has been fixed:  now correctly displays the new A6 landing page with a consistent global navigation bar, and  correctly shows the authenticated user's feed. Critical UI enhancements explaining the Trust Tiers have been integrated into the onboarding flow, user profiles, and the main social portal.

**Last working item**:
The agent was performing a final verification pass on the A6 Trust Tier Explanation Enhancements and confirming the overall stability of the application in preparation for a fork.

-   **Last item agent was working**: Verifying the four distinct UI/UX enhancements for the Trust Tiers (onboarding, tooltips, helper banner, and helper text) and fixing an issue where the authenticated social portal was inaccessible.
-   **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   **Agent Testing Done**: Y
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Manual testing via screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Environment-Aware Feature Flagging**: The logic in  was updated to check  before enabling the , effectively creating separate experiences for the dev preview and production.
-   **Static Page Architecture (A-Series)**: A pattern was established for creating premium, standalone, variant-aware static pages for the public-facing application shell.
-   **Component-Based UX Enhancement**: Enhanced user understanding of a core feature (Trust Tiers) by embedding explanatory copy and UI elements (tooltips, banners) directly into relevant frontend components (, , ).
-   **Route Separation for Auth States**: Correctly routing unauthenticated users () to a public landing page while directing authenticated users () to the internal application feed.

**key DB schema**
-   No changes made to the database schema in this session.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains the critical routing logic, including the environment-aware  and all routes for the new A-series pages.
-   : The new A6 flagship landing page for BANIBS Social.
-   : The onboarding component, now containing detailed explanations of the Trust Tiers.
-   : The authenticated social feed, which now contains the Protect your inner circle helper banner.
-   : Component for managing relationships, now enhanced with a tooltip and helper text.
-   : The main navigation bar, updated to point to the correct  route.
-   : New documentation for a future feature.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The A-series pages (, , etc.) share a significant amount of structural code and styling. They could be refactored to use a common  component that accepts content sections as props to reduce code duplication.
-   The three  variants also share a lot of code and could be refactored into a single component.

**key api endpoints**
-   No new API endpoints were created in this session.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Dev vs. Prod Experience**: The application now behaves differently in development. The  is disabled in the dev preview, so you will see the full application by default. This logic is in .
-   **Social Routing is Fixed**: The  and  routes were a source of confusion. They are now stable:  is the public landing page (A6), and  is the authenticated feed. The top navigation link points to .
-   **Trust Tier Messaging**: The user has placed a high priority on clearly explaining the relationship Trust Tiers. The enhancements are purely frontend messaging and do not involve backend logic changes.
-   **SMTP is Still Blocked**: The P0 issue for password reset emails remains blocked, awaiting SMTP credentials from the user. Do not work on it until instructed.
-   **Raymond Health System is Documentation Only**: Do not start building any code for the Raymond Health system. It is a future feature, and the work in this session was limited to creating a documentation file.

**documents created in this job**
-   
-   The roadmap file  was updated.
