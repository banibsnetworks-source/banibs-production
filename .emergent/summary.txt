<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's goal is to rapidly expand the BANIBS platform by sequentially implementing a series of new, distinct feature portals based on detailed Build Packets. This session's objectives were to build the Diaspora Connect portal (Phase 12.0), resolve all outstanding P1/P2 bugs, and then proceed with building the BANIBS Academy (Phase 13.0), BANIBS Wallet (Phase 14.0), and BANIBS OS (Phase 15.0).

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Phase 12.0: Diaspora Connect Portal:** A hub to connect the global Black diaspora through regional directories, user-submitted stories, a business directory, and educational content.
-   **P1/P2 Bug Fixes:** Resolve deferred bugs related to My Campaigns filtering, business profile data loading, and a visual glitch in a state dropdown menu.
-   **Phase 13.0: BANIBS Academy:** An educational portal featuring courses, a mentorship network, a life skills library, Black history lessons, and a scholarship/opportunity board.
-   **Phase 14.0: BANIBS Wallet / Fintech:** A financial control center for users to track spending, set budgets (envelopes), manage savings goals, and gain insights into their spending, with a focus on supporting Black-owned businesses. This phase is for data logging and UX, not real money movement.
-   **Phase 15.0: BANIBS OS / Developer Platform:** A developer-focused portal to provide API keys, an interactive API explorer, SDKs, app registration, and webhook management, enabling third-party development on the BANIBS platform.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a stable full-stack platform with a robust modular architecture. All previously known P0, P1, and P2 bugs have been resolved. The following major portals have been fully implemented (frontend and backend):
-   Prayer Rooms Portal (Phase 11.0)
-   Beauty & Wellness Portal (Phase 11.1)
-   Sneakers & Fashion Ownership Portal (Phase 11.2)
-   **Diaspora Connect Portal (Phase 12.0)**
-   **BANIBS Academy (Phase 13.0)**
-   **BANIBS Wallet / Fintech (Phase 14.0)**

The implementation of the **BANIBS OS / Developer Platform (Phase 15.0)** has been started, with the initial backend models and database layer files created.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was in the process of implementing the backend for the **BANIBS OS / Developer Platform (Phase 15.0)**. It had successfully created the Pydantic models in  and the database operations layer in .
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: backend testing agent. Once the backend is fully implemented (routes, seeding), use  with authentication to test the new endpoints.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   None. All previously listed P1 and P2 issues were resolved in this session.

**In progress Task List**:

-   **Task 1: Complete the BANIBS OS / Developer Platform (Phase 15.0) (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume**: The next step is to create the backend API routes file: .
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: This will create the technical foundation for the BANIBS ecosystem, allowing third-party developers to build apps, integrations, and plugins, significantly expanding the platform's capabilities.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both.
    -   **Blocked on something**: None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Modular Portal Architecture:** The established pattern of creating self-contained feature portals continues to be the core development strategy, enabling rapid and consistent expansion.
-   **Auth-Only Portals:** The Wallet and Developer portals introduced a stricter security model, requiring all routes within the module to be authenticated, configured via .
-   **Dynamic Backend Configuration:** The agent corrected a bug where a seeding script used a hardcoded database name instead of correctly sourcing it from the  file, reinforcing the importance of environment-aware configuration.

**key DB schema**
-   **diaspora_...**: Collections for Regions, Stories, Businesses, Education Articles, and User Snapshots.
-   **academy_...**: Collections for Courses, Mentors, Life Skills, History Lessons, and Opportunities.
-   **wallet_...**: Collections for Accounts, Transactions, Goals, Envelopes, Family Profiles, and Insight Snapshots.
-   **developer_...**: Collections for Developer Profiles, API Keys, Apps, Webhook Endpoints, and API Logs.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files**
-   **New Directories**: Full directory structures under  and  for , , and . Initial backend files for .

-   
-   
-    (Auth-only)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate and sole priority is to complete the **BANIBS OS / Developer Platform (Phase 15.0)** implementation. You have the full build packet.
-   Resume by creating the backend routes in .
-   Follow the established modular portal architecture precisely.
-   The BANIBS OS portal is **auth-only**. Ensure all backend routes are protected and frontend access is configured correctly in .
-   The user provides extremely detailed build packets. Adhere to them strictly to ensure a smooth build process.
