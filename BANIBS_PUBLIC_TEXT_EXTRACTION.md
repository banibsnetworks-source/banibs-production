### Three Pillars Section

**Pillar 1: For Our People**
A social space that puts us first — built so you can connect, organize, and share without being chased by ads or buried by somebody else's algorithm.

• No ads in your face
• No "engagement hacks" deciding who you see
• Circles and spaces you control

**Pillar 2: For Black Businesses**
BANIBS is building a place where Black businesses can be discovered, supported, and protected — without paying just to be seen.

• A directory built around us, not against us
• Tools to reach customers who actually want to find you
• Room to grow as the network grows

**Pillar 3: Protection & Integrity**
From day one, BANIBS is being built with encryption, clear rules, and our own Protection Suite so we don't have to play by the usual 'harvest everything' playbook.

*Sub-note:* We use internal integrity checks to keep our messaging honest, avoid exaggeration, and make sure we don't promise anything we can't deliver.

The NEXA browser and tools that move more of our digital life into spaces we control, step by step.

So we built one.
