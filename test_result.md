# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Phase 5 Backend Implementation - Continue BANIBS Phase 5 (Monetization, Delivery, Safety):
  
  Phase 5.1 - Paid Sponsored Placement (Stripe):
  1. Stripe checkout endpoint for contributors to sponsor their own approved opportunities
  2. Stripe webhook handler to process successful payments
  3. Update opportunities collection with sponsored status
  4. Track sponsor orders in new collection
  
  Phase 5.2 - Automated Weekly Digest Delivery:
  1. Admin endpoint to manually send weekly digest to all newsletter subscribers
  2. Log sends to newsletter_sends collection
  3. Track send history for admins
  
  RBAC rules from Phase 4 must be maintained:
  - super_admin: full access
  - moderator: can moderate but cannot sponsor, send newsletter, or view revenue

      🔧 PHASE 6.5 SENTIMENT ANALYTICS - CRITICAL BUG FIX & BACKFILL COMPLETE
      
      Fixed critical field name mismatch in sentiment aggregation:
      - News items in MongoDB use 'publishedAt' (camelCase) field
      - Aggregation service was looking for 'published_at' (snake_case)
      - Updated sentiment_aggregation_service.py line 93 and backfill_sentiment_analytics.py to use correct field
      
      ✅ Backfill Results (Oct 8 - Nov 7, 2025):
      - Successfully processed 31 days of sentiment data
      - Created overall, category, and region aggregates
      - Most active day: Nov 2 with 3 overall, 15 categories aggregates
      - Multiple days have data scattered across the 31-day period
      
      📊 Analytics Data Now Available:
      - Last 31 days of sentiment aggregates ready for analytics queries
      - 6 admin API endpoints ready for testing

        * moderation_flag in {"sensitive", "graphic", "controversial"}
        * is_heavy_content = True (manual editor override)
      - Banner message priority: custom message > default by trigger type
      - Default messages configured for sentiment, moderation, and manual triggers
      - enrich_item_with_banner_data() convenience function working across all endpoints
      
      ✅ TECHNICAL FIXES APPLIED:
      - Updated ResourcePublic model: banner_message_computed → banner_message
      - Added heavy content service import to resources.py
      - Enhanced both list and detail resource endpoints with banner data
      - Consistent field naming across all endpoints
      
      ✅ DATA CONSISTENCY VERIFICATION:
      - All tested items show heavy_content: false, banner_message: null
      - Indicates no heavy content detected in current dataset (expected)
      - When heavy content exists: heavy_content: true, banner_message: "warning text"
      - Service handles both dict and object attribute access patterns

      🛡️ PHASE 6.4 BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Sentiment-Driven Moderation Routing!
      
      Successfully implemented automated content moderation routing based on sentiment analysis:
      
      ✅ FEATURE FLAGS SYSTEM:
      - Created config/features.json with moderation settings
      - Created utils/features.py for loading and accessing flags
      - Default values: auto_from_sentiment=true, block_negative=false, threshold=-0.5
      - Graceful fallback to defaults if file missing
      
      ✅ MODERATION QUEUE:
      - MongoDB collection: moderation_queue
      - Models: ModerationQueueItem, ModerationStats, ModerationQueueUpdate
      - Database operations: create, list, get_by_id, update_status, get_stats
      - Deduplication: check_if_already_moderated prevents duplicates
      
      ✅ MODERATION SERVICE LOGIC:
      - should_moderate_content: checks feature flag + threshold + label
      - route_to_moderation: creates queue item with reason
      - handle_content_moderation: main entry point (Mode A/B support)
      - Threshold logic: sentiment_label in [negative,critical,bad] AND score <= -0.5
      
      ✅ ADMIN API ENDPOINTS (4 endpoints):
      1. GET /api/admin/moderation - list items (filter by status, content_type)
      2. GET /api/admin/moderation/stats - get counts (pending, approved, rejected, total)
      3. POST /api/admin/moderation/{id}/approve - approve item, log reviewer
      4. POST /api/admin/moderation/{id}/reject - reject item, log reviewer
      - All endpoints protected: super_admin OR moderator roles
      
      ✅ CONTENT PIPELINE INTEGRATION:
      - RSS sync: calls handle_content_moderation after sentiment analysis
      - Resource creation: calls handle_content_moderation after sentiment analysis
      - Fail-safe: moderation errors don't break content creation
      - Mode A (shadow): content visible, queue is audit log
      - Mode B (blocking): ready but disabled via block_negative=false
      
      📁 NEW FILES CREATED (8):
      - backend/config/features.json
      - backend/utils/features.py
      - backend/models/moderation.py
      - backend/db/moderation_queue.py
      - backend/services/moderation_service.py
      - backend/routes/admin/moderation.py
      
      📝 MODIFIED FILES (3):
      - backend/utils/rss_parser.py (added moderation routing)
      - backend/routes/resources.py (added moderation routing)
      - backend/server.py (registered moderation router)
      
      🎯 READY FOR TESTING:
      Priority: 7 backend tasks
      1. Feature flags loading
      2. Moderation queue database operations
      3. Moderation service logic (threshold check)
      4. Admin API endpoints (list, stats, approve, reject)
      5. RSS sync moderation integration
      6. Resource creation moderation integration
      7. Role-based access control (super_admin + moderator)
      
      Backend service restarted successfully. Ready for backend testing.
      All Phase 6.4 backend implementation complete. Ready for testing.

      🎨 PHASE 6.6 DAY 2 FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
      
      Implemented user-facing Heavy Content Banner across all surfaces:
      
      ✅ BACKEND:
      - Created GET /api/config/features endpoint to expose feature flags
      - Verified news, feed, and resources endpoints already enrich items with heavy_content and banner_message
      
      ✅ FRONTEND INTEGRATION:
      1. WorldNewsPage.js:
         - Added HeavyContentBanner import and integration
         - Fetches feature flags on mount
         - Displays banner above news cards when item.heavy_content = true
         - Uses 'card' variant
         - Respects ui.heavyContentBanner feature flag
      
      2. ResourceDetailPage.js:
         - Added HeavyContentBanner import and integration
         - Fetches feature flags on mount
         - Displays banner at top of detail view when resource.heavy_content = true
         - Uses 'banner' variant with showHideSimilar option
         - Respects ui.heavyContentBanner feature flag
      
      3. Hub ActivityFeed.js (FeedItemCard):
         - Added HeavyContentBanner import and integration
         - Fetches feature flags on mount
         - Displays banner inside feed items when item.heavy_content = true
         - Uses 'inline' variant
         - Respects ui.heavyContentBanner feature flag
      
      🎯 BANNER VARIANTS BY SURFACE:
      - WorldNewsPage news cards: variant="card" (compact banner for grid layouts)
      - ResourceDetailPage: variant="banner" (full-width banner with "hide similar" option)
      - Hub ActivityFeed items: variant="inline" (minimal inline banner)
      
      🔑 FEATURE FLAG CONTROL:
      - All surfaces check ui.heavyContentBanner flag before displaying banner
      - Currently set to false in features.json (disabled by default)
      - When enabled, banners will display on content where heavy_content = true
      
      📊 READY FOR TESTING:
      Priority: Backend + Frontend testing
      1. Test GET /api/config/features endpoint returns correct feature flags
      2. Verify news endpoints include heavy_content and banner_message
      3. Verify feed endpoint includes heavy_content and banner_message
      4. Verify resources endpoint includes heavy_content and banner_message
      5. Test banner display on WorldNewsPage with flagged content
      6. Test banner display on ResourceDetailPage with flagged content
      7. Test banner display in Hub ActivityFeed with flagged content
      8. Test local dismiss functionality
      9. Test global "hide similar" functionality
      10. Test feature flag toggle (enable/disable banner globally)
      
      Frontend and backend services running with hot reload. Ready for comprehensive testing.
