# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Phase 5 Backend Implementation - Continue BANIBS Phase 5 (Monetization, Delivery, Safety):
  
  Phase 5.1 - Paid Sponsored Placement (Stripe):
  1. Stripe checkout endpoint for contributors to sponsor their own approved opportunities
  2. Stripe webhook handler to process successful payments
  3. Update opportunities collection with sponsored status
  4. Track sponsor orders in new collection
  
  Phase 5.2 - Automated Weekly Digest Delivery:
  1. Admin endpoint to manually send weekly digest to all newsletter subscribers
  2. Log sends to newsletter_sends collection
  3. Track send history for admins
  
  RBAC rules from Phase 4 must be maintained:
  - super_admin: full access
  - moderator: can moderate but cannot sponsor, send newsletter, or view revenue

      🔧 PHASE 6.5 SENTIMENT ANALYTICS - CRITICAL BUG FIX & BACKFILL COMPLETE
      
      Fixed critical field name mismatch in sentiment aggregation:
      - News items in MongoDB use 'publishedAt' (camelCase) field
      - Aggregation service was looking for 'published_at' (snake_case)
      - Updated sentiment_aggregation_service.py line 93 and backfill_sentiment_analytics.py to use correct field
      
      ✅ Backfill Results (Oct 8 - Nov 7, 2025):
      - Successfully processed 31 days of sentiment data
      - Created overall, category, and region aggregates
      - Most active day: Nov 2 with 3 overall, 15 categories aggregates
      - Multiple days have data scattered across the 31-day period
      
      📊 Analytics Data Now Available:
      - Last 31 days of sentiment aggregates ready for analytics queries
      - 6 admin API endpoints ready for testing
      - Default 7d period will now show data in charts
      
      Ready for comprehensive backend testing of all 6 sentiment analytics endpoints plus moderation queue regression testing.

      🛡️ PHASE 6.4 BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Sentiment-Driven Moderation Routing!
      
      Successfully implemented automated content moderation routing based on sentiment analysis:
      
      ✅ FEATURE FLAGS SYSTEM:
      - Created config/features.json with moderation settings
      - Created utils/features.py for loading and accessing flags
      - Default values: auto_from_sentiment=true, block_negative=false, threshold=-0.5
      - Graceful fallback to defaults if file missing
      
      ✅ MODERATION QUEUE:
      - MongoDB collection: moderation_queue
      - Models: ModerationQueueItem, ModerationStats, ModerationQueueUpdate
      - Database operations: create, list, get_by_id, update_status, get_stats
      - Deduplication: check_if_already_moderated prevents duplicates
      
      ✅ MODERATION SERVICE LOGIC:
      - should_moderate_content: checks feature flag + threshold + label
      - route_to_moderation: creates queue item with reason
      - handle_content_moderation: main entry point (Mode A/B support)
      - Threshold logic: sentiment_label in [negative,critical,bad] AND score <= -0.5
      
      ✅ ADMIN API ENDPOINTS (4 endpoints):
      1. GET /api/admin/moderation - list items (filter by status, content_type)
      2. GET /api/admin/moderation/stats - get counts (pending, approved, rejected, total)
      3. POST /api/admin/moderation/{id}/approve - approve item, log reviewer
      4. POST /api/admin/moderation/{id}/reject - reject item, log reviewer
      - All endpoints protected: super_admin OR moderator roles
      
      ✅ CONTENT PIPELINE INTEGRATION:
      - RSS sync: calls handle_content_moderation after sentiment analysis
      - Resource creation: calls handle_content_moderation after sentiment analysis
      - Fail-safe: moderation errors don't break content creation
      - Mode A (shadow): content visible, queue is audit log
      - Mode B (blocking): ready but disabled via block_negative=false
      
      📁 NEW FILES CREATED (8):
      - backend/config/features.json
      - backend/utils/features.py
      - backend/models/moderation.py
      - backend/db/moderation_queue.py
      - backend/services/moderation_service.py
      - backend/routes/admin/moderation.py
      
      📝 MODIFIED FILES (3):
      - backend/utils/rss_parser.py (added moderation routing)
      - backend/routes/resources.py (added moderation routing)
      - backend/server.py (registered moderation router)
      
      🎯 READY FOR TESTING:
      Priority: 7 backend tasks
      1. Feature flags loading
      2. Moderation queue database operations
      3. Moderation service logic (threshold check)
      4. Admin API endpoints (list, stats, approve, reject)
      5. RSS sync moderation integration
      6. Resource creation moderation integration
      7. Role-based access control (super_admin + moderator)
      
      Backend service restarted successfully. Ready for backend testing.
      All Phase 6.4 backend implementation complete. Ready for testing.

      ✅ ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL:
      - 401 for no authentication (correct)
      - 401 for old contributor tokens (incompatible with unified auth - correct)
      - 403 for unified auth users without proper roles (correct)
      - 200 for admin tokens with super_admin role (correct)
      - All 4 moderation endpoints properly protected
      
      ✅ MODERATION DATABASE OPERATIONS:
      - All CRUD operations integrated properly with admin endpoints
      - UUID-based IDs confirmed working (not ObjectId)
      - Stats aggregation working correctly with proper counts
      - Database operations handle empty queue gracefully
      
      ✅ MODERATION SERVICE INTEGRATION:
      - Feature flag integration working correctly with threshold=-0.5
      - Service properly checks sentiment criteria for routing
      - RSS sync and resource creation integration confirmed
      - Fail-safe error handling verified
      
      ✅ AUTHENTICATION COMPATIBILITY:
